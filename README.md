# iTrackpadSwitcher

This is an AppleScript application used to switch your keyboard setting between __Natural scroll__ and __Traditional Scroll__.

## Motivation

I love the Naturla Scroll of Mac OS Lion+ since its introduction in 2011. But I always feel it's a pain while using a mouse. 

Now with this application, you wouldn't worry no more. Simply run this app whenever you connect/disconnect your mouse, and your scroll setting shall automatically be changed. Give it a try, you'll love it! 

## How to setup

1. Open up the script with AppleScript Editor.
